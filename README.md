# CODEX

> **Like Palantir, but for the Bible.** An all-source scripture intelligence terminal. 43+ translation feeds, AI fusion analysts (Talmud · gnosis · gematria · patristic commentary), an Oracle interrogator, and BabelForge — a lab to forge cover-translations of any book in any voice. Air-gap capable. Offline-first PWA. Eyes only.

## What is this

CODEX is what you'd get if a scripture-obsessed analyst sat down to build an intelligence-grade reader. A terminal, not a website. A station, not an app. Every verse is a target. Every corpus is a feed. The job is to follow the thread.

Open a verse. A column of analysts wakes up — Talmudic parallels, patristic commentary, gematria, Strong's, cross-references, and the Gnostic mirror (Nag Hammadi, Pistis Sophia, Thomas). All feeds, all the time. No paywall, no devotional pablum, no fenced-off canon. The weird stuff is on purpose — Enoch, Jubilees, Meqabyan, the apocalypses — you don't get to study a canon by reading half of it.

Then there's **BabelForge** — a translation lab. Pick a voice (1611 King James, beat poet, courtroom transcript, 1920s gangster, your bubbe), pick a source, hit forge. The model generates your own AI-translated edition of any book and installs it as a Reader translation alongside KJV. It's your cover-Bible. Make it sound like you.

## Getting started

### Run it

```
git clone https://github.com/holasoyneto/codex
cd codex
node server.js          # → http://localhost:7777
```

No `npm install`, no build step. `index.html` + `assets/` are the **committed Vite
bundle**, so a fresh clone runs immediately — pure Node, standard library only. Open
`http://localhost:7777` and drop your API key into Settings to light up the AI panels.

- **Binds `127.0.0.1` by default** (localhost only) — the `/api/chat` proxy spends your
  API key with no auth, so it must not be exposed.
- **Phone / tablet on the same Wi-Fi:** `node server.js --lan` binds `0.0.0.0` and prints
  the LAN URL. Only on a network you trust.
- **Nothing to install at all:** just open the hosted build → **https://holasoyneto.github.io/codex**

### Develop it

CODEX is a **TypeScript-strict monorepo** (npm workspaces `packages/core` + `packages/web`),
bundled with **Vite**. You only need this to *change* the app — running it needs nothing but
`node server.js`.

```
npm install         # dev tooling only (Vite, Vitest, TypeScript) — no lockfile committed
npm run dev         # Vite dev server + HMR → http://127.0.0.1:5180/index.src.html
npm run typecheck   # strict tsc across packages/core + packages/web
npm test            # full Vitest suite (jsdom)
npm run build       # bundle + promote index.html + assets/ to the repo root
npm run parity      # headless-Chrome boot-parity probe vs the golden signature
```

**The build is committed** — that's what "fork & go" means now. Edit the source HTML shell
in **`index.src.html`** (its module entry is `packages/web/src/main.ts`) — never the generated
`index.html`. `npm run build` bundles them into `assets/codex.js` + `assets/codex.css` and
promotes `index.html` + `assets/` to the repo root. **Commit the
rebuilt bundle together with your source change** — CI fails if `index.html`/`assets/` drift
from source. Cache-busting for offline users is the service-worker `VERSION` bump in `sw.js`
(mirror it in `packages/web/src/runtime/version/`).

### Connecting an AI engine

CODEX speaks to five providers — pick whichever you like, mix and match, or run them all. Keys live only in your browser (`localStorage`) and the optional `.env` for the local Node server.

- **Anthropic Claude** *(paid, highest quality)* — get a key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), drop it into Settings → API keys (starts with `sk-ant-…`). Best for nuanced exegesis and long contexts.
- **xAI Grok** *(paid)* — sign up at [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai), paste the `xai-…` key. Fast, conversational.
- **Groq** *(free, very fast)* — different company from xAI's Grok. Free tier at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) gives you Llama 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1, Mixtral, and Qwen running on custom LPU silicon. Keys start with `gsk_…`. The fastest hosted option per token.
- **Google Gemini** *(free, multimodal, 1M tokens/day)* — sign up at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), paste the key into Settings → API keys. No prefix pattern — just a long alphanumeric string. Best free tier for image + audio inputs (when we expose those).
- **Ollama** *(local, free, private)* — install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com), `ollama pull llama3.2`, then start the daemon. CODEX auto-detects it on `http://localhost:11434`. No key, no network — everything runs on your machine.

## Tech

React 18 single-page app, written as a **TypeScript-strict monorepo** (`packages/core`, `packages/web`) and bundled with **Vite** into one committed `index.html` + `assets/codex.js`/`codex.css`. React itself still loads from a CDN (one shared instance), so the bundle stays lean. The build is committed to the repo — fork it, `node server.js`, and you're running it with zero install; the "fork & go" ethos survives the move off the old CDN-Babel, no-bundler setup. Persistence lives in IndexedDB; offline lives in a Service Worker (`sw.js`, precaching the bundle); translations stream from public-domain APIs and cache locally. The plugin system means every companion panel (gematria, Talmud, gnosis, Oracle) is a self-contained TypeScript module that self-registers on load.
